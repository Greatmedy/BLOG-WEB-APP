Michael J. Scofield, portrayed by Wentworth Miller, 
is a fictional character and one of the main protagonists of the American television series Prison Break.
Miller said, "First season, I think part of my challenge was to create, hopefully, 
a compelling character. But at the same time, there were so many things I could never show, 
because standing next to Abruzzi or T-Bag or Bellick, I could not afford to be vulnerable. 
I could not afford to crack a smile."
