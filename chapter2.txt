Michael was conceived after Prison Break creator Paul Scheuring developed an idea from another producer, 
about a man who deliberately imprisons himself to break somebody out.
 In the second season, the character shows a wider range of emotions as Miller explains, 
 "He's going to have some lighter, more colorful shades... now that he's off with his brother, 
 around whom I think Michael is willing to show a side of himself that he's not with others, 
 there's a lot more that I can explore."
